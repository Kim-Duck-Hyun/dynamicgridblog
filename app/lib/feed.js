Install TiShadow:\u00a0$ <strong>npm install -g tishadow<\/strong>\r\n\r\n2. Create a TiShadow Titanium app to be installed on your device [NB: this is totally unrelated to the application you're building]\u00a0$\u00a0<strong>mkdir ~\/tishadowapp &amp;&amp;\u00a0tishadow app -d ~\/tishadowapp<\/strong>\r\n\r\n3. Install this app on your devices\/simulators, e.g.:\r\n\r\n$ <strong>cd tishadowapp\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n$ <strong>ti build --p android\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n$ <strong>ti build - ios<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOK, now your TiShadow app should be installed on your devices\/simulators.\r\n\r\n4. Run the TiShadow server:\u00a0$ <strong>tishadow server<\/strong>\r\n\r\n5. Open your simulator\/device and open the TiShadow App then type in the IP of your local machine. For me, on iOS \"localhost\" was enough but this wouldn't work on GenyMotion and I had to type my actual IP which was \"192.168.43.190\"\r\n\r\nOK, now your two simulators\/devices are connected to your TiShadow server on your machine\r\n\r\n6. Now, run either\u00a0$<strong> tishadow run<\/strong>\u00a0OR\u00a0$<strong> tishadow @ run --update<\/strong>\u00a0The second will watch for updates, the first will only push updates once.\r\n\r\nThis is the TLDR; version.

Let's cut to the chase:\r\n\r\nUsability testing is watching people use a product, like a website or mobile application, then analysing their behaviour to identify opportunities for improvement. It is used to:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Find out whether your product is easy to use<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Determine \u00a0issues\/problems that you can fix<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Find out if the product meets users' needs<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nThis is what makes usability testing unique, the act of watching your users interact with your product is what sets it apart from other forms of research such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, heuristic evaluations and even expert reviews. Don't get me wrong, all of these research methods are useful but what happens if what your user is saying turns out out to be false?<span id=\"more-195\"><\/span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Why should you test?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<strong>1. To determine what your users actually\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">do,<\/span> rather than what they <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">say <\/span>they do. <\/strong>\r\n\r\nI've numerously encountered people who say that what they're doing is a breeze but in actual fact, they're having a pretty rough time with your product. They feel the need to be polite, especially Filipinos. By watching and observing users, you can immediately debunk \u00a0which user statements are true or false. You'll be surprised with the number of issues you \u00a0can uncover through this method.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Usability testing makes you a better designer.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nEven though working professionals conjure up words such as human-centered design, user experience, design thinking, agile UX, lean UX etc, there is only a small number of those professionals who have observed people using their products. Most of the time, people base their assumptions of the perfect interface with an abstract idea of their target users. More often than not, this perfect interface is meant for themselves, not their target user. The most important thing to remember is that, you are not your user.\u00a0Usability testing is another way to broaden \u00a0your horizon as a designer and to view things through a different set of eyes.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. To avoid pitfalls early on<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is by far, one of the most valuable things you can get from usability testing. Determining and fixing problems early on before you have proceeded to design and code is more efficient, not to mention less costly. Imagine yourself deploying a product that you find out is useless to your target users. You may have to (a) redo everything (b) try to make to fix everything as soon as possible because it's already live (c) explain to the client why it's performing that way. In a nut shell, it's a whole lot of stress to go through that could have been solved early on.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Because analytics can only answer <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">how <\/span>your website is performing but not<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> why.<\/span><\/strong>\r\n\r\nYou may have an idea on how your user behaves on your website through analytics but you can't determine for sure what is the underlying cause. These two practices are meant to be paired with each other in order to maximize your insights.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>Different Types of Usability Testing<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\r\nThere are different flavors to usability testing but we can boil it down to two main types.\r\n<h6><strong>1. Summative (Quantitative)<\/strong><\/h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Objective:<\/strong> To summarize the performance of the interface<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>How it's measured:<\/strong> by metrics such as\u00a0success rate, duration of the task to be completed, error rate and user's satisfaction<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Number of users needed:\u00a0<\/strong>Jakob Nielsen recommends 20 for these types of tests.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/quantitative-studies-how-many-users\/\">http:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/quantitative-studies-how-many-users\/<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>What you can test:<\/strong> high fidelity prototype, a fully functioning website<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFormal usability tests are usually done within a controlled environment, also known as a lab but this can be done remotely as well. Summative usability tests produce quantitative results. This involves measuring metrics such as: success rate, duration of the task to be completed, error rate and user's satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFacilitators are usually not needed with these types of test since the goal is to measure the user's behaviour.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Formative (Qualitative)<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Objective:<\/strong> To determine usability pitfalls and to reshape and improve the interface<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>How it's measured:<\/strong> through observation and think out loud protocols<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Number of users needed:<\/strong> Jakob Nielsen recommends 5 types of users for this test<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>What you can test:<\/strong>\u00a0high fidelity prototype, a fully functioning website, sketches, wireframes, visual designs<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFormative usability tests are famous for the think a loud protocol. This is where a user is asked to say their thoughts while using the interface. For example: how they're feeling, what they are looking at, what frustrates them. Formative tests can be done in a lab, remotely or even in a coffee shop. These types of tests can be tweaked on the fly vs. summative tests where you have to follow a strict number of tasks otherwise the results will be contaminated.\r\n\r\nFor a quick and dirty turn around time, the Guerilla Testing method is famous amongst UX Professionals.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Stay Tuned!<\/span><\/h3>\r\nSubscribe to our RSS feed to receive your constant dose of UX goodness.

But sometimes creating Views dynamically gives us an advantage especially when displaying a complex data. For example if you will retrieve a lot of data and display it on a TableView row, it is a lot easier creating it dynamically with the use of a loop,in that case your row will be created repeatedly rather than creating it using xml one by one.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stay tuned for our next tutorial.<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"On the last part of the tutorial we created Views using the Alloy markup.

Excessive use of scripts, applets, movies, audio files, graphics and images has been avoided which means no banner blindness for the users. The site also avoids advertisements, especially pop-ups that may put off other users.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bad<\/b>\r\n\r\nReferring to the radar chart, we could clearly see that Task Orientation should be improved first, garnering a percentile score of 36% which is the lowest. A number of common tasks are hard to accomplish and new windows are used to present other data. Forms are not validated before being submitted and some writing are too short to be informative.

This is due to the fact that website shows that there is a real organisation behind the site. Page layout is 65% but can still be visually improved to distinguish itself from a generic website. Common forms used are presented on the home page which is also a plus.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bad<\/b>\r\n\r\nIf you guys are wondering why PNB got a 0% score for Search, it is due to the fact that the website does not have one. It is absolutely critical that the site would have a search included on their website. Given that the website is quite big, text heavy and has a 36% score for Navigation and Information Architecture, users would use this as a last resort to find the content they need.\u00a0 Common tasks such as finding a branch is hard to do due to the copy used and site architecture. Overall the website needs improvement on all heuristics.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">\u00a0BPI<\/span><\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_239\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"588\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/BPI-Table.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-239\" alt=\"The image above shows the overall usability score of BPI.\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/BPI-Table.png\" width=\"588\" height=\"276\" \/><\/a> The image above shows the overall usability score of BPI.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_238\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"692\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/BPI-Radar-Chart.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-238\" alt=\"BPI Radar Chart\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/BPI-Radar-Chart.png\" width=\"692\" height=\"490\" \/><\/a> The image above shows the heuristic score of BPI in a radar chart.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMoving on to our last website, BPI; the overall usability score given is 48%.\r\n\r\n<b>The Good<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe home page has the highest heuristic score with 63% but needs work on clarity of text and layout. One of the best things on the home page is the useful links seen on the first fold of the screen.\u00a0 Common tasks are relatively easy to do once you get the hang of the interface. Writing &amp; Content Quality is very concise but can sometimes be too overwhelming. Text links are long enough to be understood, but short enough to minimise wrapping.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bad<\/b>\r\n\r\nAlthough the website is also quite big, search only garnered a 26% score due to the fact that it serves just as a simple search box. Content search is not intelligent; users would have to scroll down to find what they are looking for.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also noticed during my evaluation that the website has quite a lot of long forms as well. Users can apply online for a bank account, however their help, feedback &amp; error tolerance score is only 36%, making the task tedious and hard to do. Required fields are not indicated and recovering from an error is hard to do especially for beginners.\u00a0 Multiple dialogues are used for error notification.\r\n\r\nNavigation and IA is at 48% but with all the new windows and new tabs opening when you click on a link, it can be very disorienting for the user. This is partly the main reason why the website got a 48% overall score, the lowest amongst the three. Overall the website needs improvement on all heuristics as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Comparing Metrobank, PNB, and BPI<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_237\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"688\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Bank-Comparisons.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-237\" alt=\"Metrobank, BPI and PNB comparative radar chart.\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Bank-Comparisons.png\" width=\"688\" height=\"462\" \/><\/a> The image above shows Metrobank, BPI and PNB heuristic results in a comparative radar chart.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nComparing all three Metrobank has the highest score, garnering a 55% usability score followed by PNB with 49% and BPI with 48%.\r\n\r\nAll three websites have a relatively high score on Page Layout &amp; Visual Design, only a few points shy from the standard score.\u00a0 Carrying out tasks is harder on the Metrobank website compared to the other three. As for Writing &amp; Content Quality, all three have a similar figure as well. PNB, has the highest heuristic score for Trust &amp; Credibility thanks to the complete company information and a brief background on their employees. Accomplishing forms is a hassle on BPI due to the lack of live inline validation and error prevention. Help, Feedback and Error Tolerance is below 60% for all three while search is the most neglected heuristic seen as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">But wait there's more!<\/span><\/h3>\r\nYup, you've read that right. This post is focused on actual experts giving out feedback but how about the people who uses the product? Don't worry, we will be conducting a usability test on these websites (BPI, Metrobank, and PNB) as well to see how they perform with actual consumers or what we like to call them, users. Sounds exciting? Well stay tuned.

I suggest reading it first to get a good look and feel of what a heuristic evaluation is.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"A Beginner's Guide to Heuristic Evaluation (Part 1)\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/2013\/11\/beginners-guide-heuristic-evaluation-part-1\/\">A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Heuristic Evaluation (Part 1)<\/a>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Moving on<\/span><\/h3>\r\nI guess by this time you've already prepared the materials or even so, the people to do your evaluation. Before we start, I want to be perfectly clear that a heuristic evaluation can be a subjective form of an assessment. Remember, a number 2 score for another person might be a number 1 score for another. \u00a0I could not emphasize enough to do a usability test to complement and debunk some of the issues you've encountered during your evaluation.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Conducting the Evaluation<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nThere are two ways to conduct the evaluation, an individual evaluation or a group evaluation. I did this evaluation by myself so I have to go with an individual evaluation. Tune in on part 3 of our blog post to learn how to do a group evaluation with your team.<span id=\"more-164\"><\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Individual Evaluation<\/b> \u2013 each reviewer will\u00a0go through your website by themselves. After they are done with the evaluation all the issues seen would be reported to you. You can choose to brainstorm with the other evaluators after they are done or just go through the list of issues by yourself. Conducting a brainstorm together is better though, you guys can dissect and prioritize issues together.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Can be done remotely<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Allows reviewers to focus on their tasks<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Easier to facilitate, you basically brief them and get your results after<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nCons:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>A lot more issues will be reported<\/li>\r\n\t<li>May have a longer turnaround time<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<b>Group Evaluation \u2013 <\/b>evaluators review the interface with the team while one person records all the problems. This person can be you or somebody else. The key here is that evaluators must assess the problem together and its severity. They don\u2019t have to agree on the same problem, you guys can vote or leave it to the usability test to see which should be prioritized.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>One time facilitation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Real time discussion<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Issues are prioritized on the spot<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nCons:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Harder to prepare and schedule<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Starting the individual evaluation<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nStart the heuristic evaluation by briefing your evaluators. Relay the goals and target market of the website and the main tasks that they have to go through. If your reviewer is not a usability expert, an explanation of the heuristics must be done. Since we have a heuristic dedicated to the home page, I usually start the evaluation there then proceed to the main tasks that I have done.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a short breakdown of my methodology:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Find out who the website is for, what is its purpose or goal from the facilitator<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Receive tasks that I have to do from the facilitator (If you plan to do a usability test after the heuristic evaluation, the tasks for the usability test should be the same)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Start the evaluation with the assessment of the home page<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Carry out my tasks while taking note of issues and problems I've encountered. At this point I\u2019ll start giving a score on my heuristics.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\nOnce I'm done carrying out my tasks and completed my evaluation. I\u2019ll end up with an overall usability score of the website and a radar chart as well. I would then proceed to the next website I would assess.\r\n<h4><b>FAQs<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<b>I don\u2019t know if this heuristic applies to the website<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b><\/b>Hey, no worries. Not all heuristics are going to be used in the assessment. Simply skip that question and leave it blank.\r\n\r\n<b>I can\u2019t do the task while giving scores on my heuristics<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is basically the problem I had when starting out. Just take it slow and do the tasks that are assigned to you. If you have to go over them again, do so. One trick I would do is to see where the problem I've found can be applied. For example Information Architecture, find a specific question tailored to that problem from your excel sheet. If there\u2019s none, take note of it and discuss it with your facilitator and team.\r\n\r\n<b>I've\u00a0done all the tasks but have a lot more heuristics to cover<\/b>\r\n\r\nSometimes there are tasks that won\u2019t have any forms involved; however you have it as one of your heuristics. What you can do is look for a form, if they have one, then assess it.\r\n\r\n<b>Can the facilitator be an evaluator as well?<\/b>\r\n\r\nYes, sometimes the facilitator is just a member of your team or maybe a person who will lead the discussion later on.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Analysing your results<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nOnce every one of your evaluator is done, you can start by reviewing each heuristic individually. Start at the home page and work your way down. Remove any similar or duplicate comments seen by the evaluators if you have more than one evaluator. You can do this by yourself or choose to do a brainstorming session with your evaluators after they are done. Next, tally the overall score of your website. Here\u2019s the formula in case you need it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sum of evaluator scores \/ (100)(# of evaluators) = A<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>A x 100 = Average Score<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFor Example:\r\n\r\nEvaluator 1: 70% ; Evaluator 2: 55%; Evaluator 3: 60%\r\n\r\n70% + 55% + 60% = 185%\r\n\r\n(100)(3) = 300%\r\n\r\n185%\/300% = 0.61\r\n\r\n0.61 x 100 = 61% Average Score\r\n\r\nSo I guess you\u2019re thinking what does the score I've tallied mean? Is this a good score or a bad score? Ideally a website should at least get a 75% Usability Score. Each heuristic should at least have a 75% score as well to keep it balanced, something like the table below.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Overall-Table.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-179 \" alt=\"The image above shows the overall usability score of a website I've evaluated.

Excessive use of scripts, applets, movies, audio files, graphics and images has been avoided which means no banner blindness for the users. The site also avoids advertisements, especially pop-ups that may put off other users.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bad<\/b>\r\n\r\nReferring to the radar chart, we could clearly see that Task Orientation should be improved first, garnering a percentile score of 36% which is the lowest. A number of common tasks are hard to accomplish and new windows are used to present other data. Forms are not validated before being submitted and some writing are too short to be informative. Overall the website needs improvement on all heuristics.\r\n<h3>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Comparing Websites<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nIf you've evaluated a single website only, you can skip this part. But hey, a little more knowledge is better than none.\r\n\r\nTo emphasize each heuristic you have calculated you can overlay one radar plot on another.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_181\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"693\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Dummy-Comparison-Radar-Chart.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-181 \" alt=\"The image above shows three websites with an overall score of 55%, 49% and 48%. \" src=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Dummy-Comparison-Radar-Chart.png\" width=\"693\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a> The image above shows three websites with an overall score of 55%, 49% and 48%.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSee, now you have a clearer view of the results of each website.\r\n\r\nAs you can see all of them have strong and weak points to their website. All three websites have a relatively high score for their home page. Writing and content quality has the most similar figures out of all heuristics with search being the lowest for all three websites.\r\n\r\nSeeing that you've pinpointed your competitor\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, it is now up to you how to use this to your advantage.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Ok, now I have my score. What do I do next?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nYou can start by prioritizing which problems to tackle with your team. Since you have your excel sheet full of notes and scores, you simply have to segregate your data and fix the problems with the lowest value first. In my case the value (-1) is the lowest value on our scoring system.\r\n\r\nMaybe now you\u2019re thinking, \u201cBut there a lot of -1s in my scores, how do I know which to fix first?\u201d Remember, it\u2019s always easier to do quick fixes first. For example, things like copy changes and colours of call to action buttons. By doing quick fixes first you will immediately minimize the severity of the issues and it might even solve the problem completely. Consult with your team and see what you guys can do immediately.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><b>Wait, there\u2019s more!<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nSince we love you guys so much, Part 3 of our blog post would be how to conduct a group heuristic evaluation.

Thinking takes, and wastes time.\r\n\r\nIn Manila i havn't found 2 bank machines that follow the same design patterns or flows. There are inconsistencies in flow, button layout and even terminology across different banks. Some banks even have differing interfaces between their own machines.\r\n\r\nI like to think i'm very efficient at using cash machines, infact it annoys me when the people in front of me takes their time to withdraw money.\r\n\r\nI have a mental note of approximately how much money i have in my account, so i dont need to do a balance inquiry before withdrawing. I have observed that lots of people don't do the same, they need to check their balance before selecting how much to withdraw.\r\n\r\n<strong>For starters, this begs the question, why on earth are these two interactions treated separetly? Why not display the available balance on the cash withdrawal screen as a visual reference?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt occured to me that maybe i'm strange, because i opt to use any machine that is available (regardless of charges incurred) rather than sticking to my own bank. I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one, but even if i was there is surely a much better way to design such a commonly used set of actions.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do you experience this in the countries you live in? <\/strong>\r\n\r\nIs there a way to standardise cash machine interactions?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/groups\/Theres-interaction-i-perform-least-2529386.S.5815327783844335619?qid=5c1c8c06-c6e7-4806-bcb6-9962498d7d2e&amp;trk=groups_most_recent-0-b-ttl&amp;goback=%2Egmp_2529386%2Egmr_2529386\" target=\"_blank\">Join the discussion on the friends of the intercation design foundation linkedin group<\/a>","excerpt":"ATM interface design seems to have stood still.

Before we actually teach and walk you through the process of evaluation, we first must learn how to:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Create heuristics<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Score your findings<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Visualize your scores<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Create tasks.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h6><b>Starting your first website evaluation can be a doozy<\/b><\/h6>\r\nI remember starting my first usability audit in the office and I can tell you it was not a walk in the park. Usability best practices were not in my UX toolkit yet and not knowing whether was I right or wrong is the worst part. This is where I realized that a structured review methodology can be a crucial arsenal in your toolkit, especially for first timers. Keeping things formal, organized and consistent will make our evaluation faster and consistent in the future. Luckily there are loads of online resources today that we can use.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff9900\"><b>What is a heuristic evaluation?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nA heuristic evaluation is a review methodology or discount usability method for a quick, <span id=\"more-116\"><\/span>cheap and informative way of assessing your interface. A set of heuristics or general rules of thumb, are used to critique and score your website. Radar diagrams are also used to visualize weaknesses in the system. At the end of each heuristic evaluation you end up with an overall usability score of your website and a list of things you can improve on.\r\n\r\n<b>Advantages<\/b>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fast feedback for designers<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Feedback can be obtained early in the design process<b><\/b><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Inexpensive compared to other methods: this depends whether you get experts to assess your website<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Faster turnaround time than usability testing<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h6><b>Disadvantages<\/b><\/h6>\r\nAlthough Heuristic Evaluation provides quick and relatively cheap feedback to designers, it is best to be aware of some of the drawbacks that it has.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Heuristic Evaluations will miss certain issues:<\/b> This type of methodology is not meant to be used alone. It works best when paired with usability testing, by doing so you can validate your findings and determine other issues not seen during the evaluation.<b><\/b><\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>Heuristic Evaluations tend to uncover a lot more issues: <\/b>The question is how do you prioritize which issues should be fixed first? Don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll discuss this on part 2 of the blog post.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>Heuristic Evaluations are more fruitful with experts:<\/b> This is due to the fact that experts apply their years of experience to the evaluation.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>Not all heuristics will apply to you:<\/b> It is important to know that some heuristics may not apply to your product. There are multiple heuristics sets available online which you can use depending on your project.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h6><b>Who can perform a heuristic evaluation?<\/b><\/h6>\r\nAnybody, as long as you have a set of reliable heuristics with you. Although three to five experts provides better results, assessing your website with a set of heuristics is better than doing nothing. The key is to have more than one evaluator (3 to 5) to assess your website, by doing so you can have a direct comparison of which are false alarms and which issues are reoccurring. Remember, the goal is to find issues you can fix, rather than how many problems you can uncover.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><i>5 experts will uncover 75% of usability issues<\/i><\/li>\r\n\t<li><i>5 non-experts will uncover 22 \u2013 29% of usability issues<\/i><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h6><b>When is the right time to perform a heuristic evaluation?<\/b><\/h6>\r\nIt can be conducted at various stages of the development lifecycle, preferably at the start in order to determine issues early on in the project.\r\n\r\nHeuristic evaluation can also be used to compare performance of competitors. This is particularly good in determining which aspects \u00a0competitors fail in, and how might we avoid these failures in the future. But of course comparing multiple websites can be tedious and time consuming; this is why choosing the correct heuristics is crucial.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff9900\"><b>Before you start your evaluation<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<h6><b>What you need:<\/b><\/h6>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><b>Three to Five evaluators<\/b>: If you have the resources to hire a usability expert that would be awesome!<\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>A website to assess<\/b><\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>A set of heuristics: <\/b>What we use is from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.userfocus.co.uk\/resources\/guidelines.html\" target=\"_blank\">User Focus' Web Usability Guidelines<\/a>,\u00a0with a minor tweak. We included accessibility as a heuristic as well. All you need to do is include your rating and the excel sheet automatically calculates your score and generates a radar diagram. Thanks so much Dr. Travis for this!<\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>Tasks for your evaluators<\/b><\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>Pen and Paper: <\/b>You never know what you\u2019ll want to write down.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<h6><b>Creating or defining your heuristics<\/b><\/h6>\r\nIn order to properly review your website, all facets and layers should be evaluated. That includes your design, down to your functionality. For beginners you can download a set of heuristics that are available online. Here's a few of my favourites:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/ten-usability-heuristics\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jakob Nielsen\u2019s 10 Heuristics<\/a>: This of course is the most famous one.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.userfocus.co.uk\/articles\/expertreviews.html\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 9241-110<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usereffect.com\/topic\/25-point-website-usability-checklist\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Peter Meyers's 25-point checklist<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.userfocus.co.uk\/resources\/guidelines.html\" target=\"_blank\">User Focus' Web Usability Guidelines<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nNow getting back on track, as mentioned previously we use UserFocus\u2019 set of heuristics which are:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Home Page<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Task orientation and website functionality<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Navigation and information architecture<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Forms and data entry<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Trust and credibility<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Quality of writing and content<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Search<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Help, feedback and error tolerance<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Page layout and visual design<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Accessibility<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFrom these categories we can further slice them into specific questions. This allows us to create a formal checklist before assessing our website. One of the key advantages of a checklist is to make sure that nothing is forgotten.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s use the heuristic, Task orientation and website functionality. Some questions you can form for this heuristic are:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>From only looking at the home page, does the first time user understand where to start?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Is the value proposition clearly stated on the home page?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Does the design of the home page encourage people to explore the site?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h6><b>How to score your heuristics<\/b><\/h6>\r\nYour heuristics can be scored in many ways, but the simplest we can do is to follow Leigh Howell\u2019s scoring system from Smashing Magazine. Your scoring metric will go like this:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>0 points:<\/b> does not comply with the heuristic<\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>1 point:<\/b> kind of complies with the heuristic (ex. Some forms have error prompts but other pages don\u2019t)<\/li>\r\n\t<li><b>2 points:<\/b> complies with the heuristic on all pages<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAll points will then be totalled per heuristic and an overall score will be derived at the end. Your formula would be like this.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\" align=\"center\"><strong><em>(Actual Score \/ Possible Score) * 100 = Total<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\nFor Example:\r\n\r\nHome Page Heuristic: (38\/40) * 100 = 95%\r\n\r\nOverall score: (465\/484) * 100 = 96.07%\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_119\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"588\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Summary-Heuristic-Data-Sheet.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-119 \" alt=\"Heuristic Data Sheet\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Summary-Heuristic-Data-Sheet.png\" width=\"588\" height=\"238\" \/><\/a> The above table shows total heuristic scores per category.

The more circular and larger the shape is, the better it performs. The more spikes seen in the shape, meaning more variation of scores.\u00a0Take note that you read the points of the radar not the slices.\r\n\r\nRadar charts are not for everybody. If you feel that using a different type of chart is better suited to present your data, feel free to do so. \u00a0In our case, we find that radar charts is what fits best in our evaluations, especially for \u00a0comparative reviews.\r\n\r\nPlease also be mindful that what's important here is to identify the problems within your website and to have an actual usability standard on your digital products in all aspects (Navigation, Page Layout, Search, etc).The scoring is important but the goal here is finding the issues you can fix and applying the guidelines you have with you in a effective and much organized manner.\r\n\r\nSince excel sheets are awesome, a radar chart or just about any type of chart is automatically generated for you! Just click the insert button and choose a chart to your liking.\u00a0You can then go back to your data sheet or heuristic table to determine which issues you shall address first based on the chart.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_121\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"565\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Radar-Diagram.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-121 \" title=\"Radar Diagram\" alt=\"Radar Diagram\" src=\"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Radar-Diagram.png\" width=\"565\" height=\"350\" \/><\/a> A radar diagram of a website that performs well in all areas except \u201cAccessibility.\u201d[\/caption]\r\n<h6><b>Creating Tasks for your evaluators<\/b><\/h6>\r\nThe quality of the evaluation can be improved by providing specific tasks or scenarios for your evaluators to complete. The first step is to jot down a list of the most important tasks that people need to be able to do on your site. You can do this together with your evaluators; you can even gather some insights from the site owner as well.\r\n\r\nHere are some tasks you might end up with:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sign up on my website.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Place an order on the website by using Paypal.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe number of tasks will be up to you, but usually five major tasks is sufficient . Take note that more tasks will also mean more time evaluating.\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff9900\"><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\nA heuristic evaluation provides users with a concrete methodology to follow, both for beginners and expert UX Professionals.

My overall take away from all of the thought provoking talks is:\r\n<h3>UX is a not a step in the process; it is a culture that needs to be nurtured. \u00a0UX needs great forward thinking designers, who solve problems over and over again.<\/h3>\r\nIn Manila we've been selling UX short, for far too long. <span id=\"more-72\"><\/span>\u00a0This stems from UX being a support to creative concepts, and the term UX being an in fashion buzzword, being thrown around by far too many people.\r\n\r\nIt's time for this to change.\r\n\r\nUX being a step in the process is something that is very difficult to undo. \u00a0When you plant a seed you can't change your mind after a few days, months or years and rethink the fundamental way in which that seed will grow. \u00a0In that sense, creating a UX culture needs to be from the ground up; you need to start as you mean to go on... and for most companies that means big changes need to take place.\r\n\r\nThis very insight, is a very large part of the reason Foolproof Labs was founded. \u00a0 Phil and I got tired of the status quo, we knew there was a better way to work and create projects that not only physically work, but also fill a need, a user need - not cash in the bank.\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting time for UX in South East Asia. \u00a0I have so much respect for people like Izwan, who are pushing the industry forward, through educating people and creating amazing conferences and workshops. \u00a0Keep up the good work buddy.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about UX Malaysia head over to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/uxmalaysia\">facebook page<\/a>\u00a0or check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/uxmalaysia.com\/2013\/\">website<\/a>.","excerpt":"Last weekend i was lucky enough to attend the very first UX Malaysia conference. &Acirc;&nbsp;It&amp;#8217;s the first UX conference i&amp;#8217;d ever attended; it honestly felt so good to be around some many like minded people. &Acirc;&nbsp;Hosted in the very impressive Microsoft office in the Petronas towers, the event was sold out. &Acirc;&nbsp;There were talks from [&amp;hellip;]","date":"2013-11-14 09:59:16","author":"Russell Morgan","categories":["Usability","UX"],"tags":[]},{"id":65,"title":"How to reduce your Titanium Android build\/install\/test cycle","permalink":"http:\/\/blog.foolprooflabs.com\/2013\/10\/run-titanium-android-project-faster\/","content":"I recently had to use Appcelerator's updated <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.appcelerator.com\/titanium\/3.0\/#!\/guide\/Google_Maps_v2_for_Android-section-36739898_GoogleMapsv2forAndroid-Introduction\">Google Maps module<\/a> for a project which, if you read the documentation \"Only works on Android devices.
